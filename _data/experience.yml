   We believe that by engaging the community in our mission we can move the needle creatively and environmentally. When we make craft materials available at a low cost to the community, we encourage creative exploration.  When we build creative skills with reclaimed materials in our workshops, we start to change the perception about the value of everyday items. As we share our mission to divert usable materials from the waste stream, we help create a mindfulness of over-consumption and waste. As our community comes to value greater creative expression and reduction of waste, we move toward a more livable and resourceful society.
